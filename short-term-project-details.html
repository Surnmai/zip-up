      <h3>short term project</h3>
      <p>
        The short-term projects will include
        <small
          >• Scholarships for persons with disability in orphanage communities
          or institutions</small
        >
        <small>• Annual JHS, SHS, and Tertiary Institutions Debate</small>
        <small
          >• Provide business start-up resources for persons with a mobility
          challenge.
        </small>
        <strong>Scholarships</strong>
        Persons with disabilities need special care and support. However, the
        realities of people with disabilities who live with family and that of
        those who live in orphanage homes and institutions are quite different.
        Though the reverse might be true in some cases, we believe PWDs who are
        orphans have no other person but their supervisors hence the need for
        the secretariat to step in and assist exceptional students to climb to
        the higher educational ladder. The scholarship will cover Tuition,
        accommodation if need be and allowances agreed upon by the board of
        directors. However, the Secretariat shall not be responsible for all
        other expenses like medical bills, daily transportation around, and
        feeding.
        <strong>WHO QUALIFIES?</strong>
        <small
          >• Person must be living with a disability and has lost a
          parent</small
        >
        <small
          >• Must be brilliant and exceptional in their field of study</small
        >
        <small
          >• Must not have a condition that is life-threatening to the
          individual and others</small
        >
        <small>• Must not have any criminal record </small>
        <small>• Must be mentally fit to pursue the program </small>
        <strong>Annual Debate </strong>
        The annual debate is aimed at building the youth to learn public
        speaking and articulate their thoughts such that, they can have healthy
        conversations. The goal is to curb the mess of verbal abuse where people
        mostly resort to offensive and abusive language to air their views in
        their quest to win arguments. Secondly, the debate is a mental exercise
        for students to train themselves to be critical thinkers. The program
        will concentrate on building student leadership traits and enhancing
        their negotiation skills.
        <strong>START-UP CAPITAL FOR PERSONS WITH MOBILITY CHALLENGES</strong>
        There is a saying among the Akan people that goes “there is no better
        advice than take this (capital) and start a life with” It is not enough
        to inspire people to live an independent life in a competitive world
        where the variables are different and the odds are not so much in their
        favor. It is, for this reason, we want to bridge the gap by providing
        training and capital to persons with mobility challenges who are willing
        to make a living for themselves.
        <strong>WHY PERSONS WITH MOBILITY CHALLENGES?</strong>
        People live in different challenges and conditions. As much as we as an
        organization would want to assist and help all, it is nearly impossible
        to do all that at a time. Hence the decision to start with persons with
        mobility challenges. That is not to say persons living with other
        challenges are not a priority to us. Everybody is important and as time
        goes on, we hope to be able to touch more lives however, for now, our
        focus is on persons with mobility challenges.
