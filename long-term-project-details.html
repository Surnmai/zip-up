      <h3>long term projects</h3>
      <p>
        The secretariat hopes to have a training facility that will focus on
        building the talents of persons with disability with special slots for
        orphans. This facility will consist of five departments. Department of
        Robotics, department of arts and Design, department of music and drama,
        and Department of IT.
        <strong>Department of Robotics</strong>
        Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of computer science and
        engineering. Robotics involves the design, construction, operation, and
        use of robots. The goal of robotics is to design machines that can help
        and assist humans. The department will focus on designs that will best
        solve problems within the African community, especially in the areas of
        agriculture and household maintenance, and build machines that will be
        instrumental in aiding persons with disabilities. The department will
        partner with existing companies and organizations for exchange programs
        and expertise in various fields to assist in teaching, learning, and
        inventing new technological ideas.
        <strong>ARTS AND DESIGN</strong>
        Art and Design are about fostering creativity and imagination by
        building on their knowledge, skills, and understanding of materials and
        processes. Arts and Design Covering a vast range of skills and talents,
        art and design is a diverse subject that will help you turn your
        creative passion into a money-making career. Specific areas of study
        will be determined by the status quo at the time of commencement.
        <strong>DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC AND DRAMA</strong>
        This department will focus on building talents for the entertainment
        industry. Currently, the entertainment industry has very few persons
        with Disability in the system that has made it. Seven in ten people will
        not able to name three talents with disability in Ghana. The department
        will train people in instruments, music, dramatic art, and dance.
        Training will not end on campus; the department will connect students
        with industry players to have joint and independent projects. Steven
        Knightâ€™s TV series SEE is a story about a civilization that lost its
        sense of sight. The story is about a blind community and casts five
        visually impaired actors. Among the cast was Marilee Talkington an
        advocate for the representation of persons with disability in the film
        industry. It is one thing asking directors to cast PWDs in their
        production. However, these people need the required training to become
        professionals who will understand the business.
        <strong>HOW THE ORGANIZATION IS GOING TO FUND PROJECTS</strong>
        The organization will depend largely on donors. Locally and
        internationally. We hope to bring donations to the very least of society
        where everybody is a donor. The rich, the middle-class man, the student,
        the poor; everybody can be and is a donor. The organization hopes to
        partner with businesses and institutions to raise funds to support the
        foundations. The organization will partner with other organizations and
        individuals to raise funds to support the organization.
